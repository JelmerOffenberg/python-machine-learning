    "\n",
    "This dataset is relatively easy an small to work with. This will help us to get a good understanding of the tools that we work with. The goal is to predict median house values in California. Along the way, you will practice splitting data, fitting models, evaluating performance, and comparing approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives you the structure. You will fill in the details yourself. Explore and discovery various approaches each step, work together and discuss. Make it interactive. Try to minimize copy-pasting of sections so that you really understand what's going on."
